Currently https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/ does not contain Jenkins 2.x updates because they are not stable, you can find 
the weekly versions here https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/jenkins/

This repo is exactly as the official Jenkins but then for Jenkins 2.x, I just want to be in controll :)

All the credits go to the official Jenkins!
